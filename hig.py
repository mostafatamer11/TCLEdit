"""what will you do?
(ask him nicely, stay in the carriage, use knive to get out)
    1- ask him nicely: the goblin laughs and leaves you tied up.
    you arrive at the goblin's hut and he ate you
    2- use knive to get out: you escape and find yourself in a random forest.
    There, you encounter a strange device, would you touch it?
    (yes, no)
        1-yes: The device sends a signal to nearby aliens on mars.
            you get abducted by the aliens.
            they are going to eat you
            what will you do?
            (tell them a joke, challenge them, attack them)
                1- tell them a joke: they find you weird but not dangerous, so they bring you back to earth
                2- challenge them: they offer you some randomly based challenges, which would you choose?
                (roll a dice for a number more than 4, play كيلو بامية, play rock paper scissors)
                3 

        2-you walk away and avoid it, good choice
    3- stay in the carriage: you arrive to the goblin's hut """
